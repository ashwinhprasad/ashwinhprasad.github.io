This is a page about Stoicism, an ancient philosophy that emphasizes virtue, rationality, and resilience in the face of adversity.

## The Origins of Stoicism

Stoicism was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium around 300 BCE. It later developed and spread throughout the Roman Empire, with notable practitioners including Seneca, Epictetus, and Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

## Core Principles

### The Dichotomy of Control

One of the most fundamental Stoic teachings is understanding what is within our control and what isn't.

### Virtue as the Highest Good

Stoics believed that virtue (arete) is the only true good, and that external circumstances—wealth, health, reputation—are ultimately indifferent.

### Rational Emotions

Stoicism advocates for managing emotions through reason, not suppressing them entirely.

## Stoic Practices

### Negative Visualization

Contemplating worst-case scenarios to reduce anxiety and appreciate what you have.

### Mindful Awareness

Staying present and being aware of judgments we attach to events.

## Modern Applications

### Stoicism in Psychology

Many modern therapeutic approaches, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), have roots in Stoic practices.
