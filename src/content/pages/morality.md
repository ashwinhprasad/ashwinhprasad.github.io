Morality and ethics are central to human society. They guide our decisions, shape our interactions, and influence our understanding of right and wrong. Through the study of ethics, we can better navigate complex moral dilemmas and strive to live virtuous lives.

## Introduction to Ethics

Ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with systematic approaches to understanding, analyzing, and distinguishing matters of right and wrong, good and bad, and admirable and deplorable as they relate to the well-being of and the relationships among sentient beings.

### Normative Ethics

Normative ethics is concerned with ethical action and is the study of ethical theories that prescribe how people ought to act.

#### Consequentialism

Consequentialism focuses on the consequences or results of actions. According to this view, correct actions are those that produce the most good.

#### Deontology

Deontological ethics focuses on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, as opposed to the rightness or wrongness of the consequences of those actions.

### Meta-Ethics

Meta-ethics is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments.

## Moral Virtues

Virtues are character traits or qualities valued as being good. They include honesty, courage, compassion, generosity, fidelity, integrity, fairness, self-control, and prudence.

```python
# Example of ethical decision making algorithm
def evaluate_action(action, consequences, intentions):
    """Simplified ethical evaluation function"""
    moral_value = 0
    
    # Consequentialist evaluation
    moral_value += sum([c.value for c in consequences])
    
    # Deontological evaluation
    moral_value += intentions.adherence_to_moral_duty * 0.5
    
    return moral_value > 0  # True if morally acceptable
```
